>Obi-Wan Kenobi:
You were the chosen one! It was said that 
you would destroy the Sith, not join them. 
You were to bring balance to the force, not 
leave it in darkness. You were my brother, 
Anakin. I loved you.
>Yoda
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my 
size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. 
For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it 
is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy 
surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, 
not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around 
you; between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere. 
Yes, even between the land and the ship.
>Princess Leia Organa
General Kenobi: Years ago, you served my father in the 
Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle 
against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present 
my father's request to you in person, but my ship has 
fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring 
you to Alderaan has failed. I've placed information vital 
to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems 
of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. 
You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. 
This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
You're my only hope.
